Holder of a web programming certification obtained in December 2019 at CEPADOC, I have strengthened my technical skills, enabling me to successfully realize various projects.

Graduated in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, class of 2023, with a thesis entitled "Modernization of Land Title Allocation Mechanisms with a Secure Approach based on Blockchain Technology."

In parallel with my academic journey, I completed an academic internship at Rawbank. My mission was to update all the bank's commercial agents. The main objective was to define specific goals for the year 2021, aiming to expand the customer base and strengthen the bank's influence in the financial market. This experience was an opportunity to apply my academic skills in a dynamic professional environment, contributing to crucial strategic initiatives for the banking institution.

My journey also includes an academic internship in the Billing & IT department at VODACOM RDC, where I deepened my skills in software development.

Beyond my academic path, I completed a two-month internship as a web developer at Monglish, applying my skills in web development.

I then enriched my experience with a two-month internship followed by a part-time job as a software engineer at Healthcarologie, a company specialized in creating software for hospital management. These experiences offered me a practical and diversified perspective in the field of software development and technology applied to healthcare.

These experiences have given me a clearer understanding of the challenges and missions related to the roles of a developer and IT support, and above all, have allowed me to develop a certain versatility in the professional context. üåêüí° #Developer #IT #Blockchain
